                <h4> Hi, my name is Natnael and I'm an Information Technology Student.
                        
                    I was born and raised at Addis around Bisrate Gabriel.  I am currently studying a full time IT 
                         course at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology which involves computing, mathematics, programming and web design.
                         I am a very creative person and would love to be able to learn more about the programmes used to put my ideas into theory and work my way to completing the course and working my way through university to become a professional web designer.
                         Besides that i really enjoy to listen to music specially Rap and Afro. I also like to play and watch several sports . Feel free to contact.
